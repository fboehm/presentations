## Study design




- Nearly 1000 DO mice
- Vaccinated and unvaccinated are challenged with Mtb
- Measured lung CFU, spleen CFU, lung histopathology, and body weight
- In nearly 100 vaccinated mice, obtained blood samples (pre- and post-vaccination) for RNA seq analysis

## Plans for RNA seq analysis

- Align reads to individual DO genomes
- Quantify reads and calculate quantitative traits for QTL mapping
- Compare and integrate results with CC QTL mapping
  - Do RNAseq peaks overlap with peaks in CC? 
  - Can we infer allelic series at QTL in DO cohort and detect similar QTL in CC?
