## Example Projects

2. **Multivariate longitudinal modeling of biobank traits**  

3. **Joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event traits in biobanks**

4. **Can we use genetics-based risk predictors in specific patient populations to guide treatment decisions?**


## Opportunities

- Collaborate with geneticists & clinicians  
- Develop statistical modeling skills, including Bayesian hierarchical models  
- Statistical computing skills development, including computing with sample sizes over 100,000
