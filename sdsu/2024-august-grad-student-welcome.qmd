## Research Mission

To develop tools and methods to enable clinical applications of human genetics discoveries

- **Example**: Epidemiology studies identified about a dozen risk factors for heart attacks, and clinicians now assess them in many patients to quantitatively assess heart attack risk in a patient.  
- Human genetics studies have identified hundreds of genetic variants that associate with heart attacks. Can we create a *better* risk predictor by combining epidemiology and human genetics discoveries?




## Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Biobanks 

- Identify variant-disease associations in tens or hundreds of thousands of people
