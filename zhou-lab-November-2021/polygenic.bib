            A promise of genomics in precision medicine is to provide individualized genetic risk predictions. Polygenic risk scores ({PRS}), computed by aggregating effects from many genomic variants, have been developed as a useful tool in complex disease research. However, the application of {PRS} as a tool for predicting an individual’s disease susceptibility in a clinical setting is challenging because {PRS} typically provide a relative measure of risk evaluated at the level of a group of people but not at individual level. Here, we introduce a machine-learning technique, Mondrian Cross-Conformal Prediction ({MCCP}), to estimate the confidence bounds of {PRS}-to-disease-risk prediction. {MCCP} can report disease status conditional probability value for each individual and give a prediction at a desired error level. Moreover, with a user-defined prediction error rate, {MCCP} can estimate the proportion of sample (coverage) with a correct prediction.},
