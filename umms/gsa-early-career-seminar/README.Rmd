## Backward design & planning

Things that need to be explained:

1. Jiang & Zeng 1995 method
1. DO mice genomes
1. My test
  1. multivariate linear model
  1. Calculating test statistic
  1. Recla example

Things to include:

1. my contact info
  1. email
  1. url for presentation slides (and github repo for this presentation)
  1. github info
  1. my website's url
  1. link to github site for qtl2pleio
  1. link & ref to my G3 paper

Considerations:

1. think of the talk as an advertisement for the paper and R package
