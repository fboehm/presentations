Hello, and welcome to my poster! My name is Fred Boehm, and I'm a postdoctoral researcher at University of Massachusetts Medical School. My colleagues and I study the host immune response to tuberculosis infections.




In this study, we use mice from two genetically diverse cohorts - the Collaborative Cross and the Diversity Outbred - in efforts to understand genetics of host biology in response to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (or Mtb), the causal agent of tuberculosis.

Early studies in Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice identified quantitative trait loci - or QTL - that affect variability in traits like Mtb burden in lungs and spleen. Interestingly, some DO QTL weren't detected in CC cohorts, and vice versa. While study design contributes to the variable results, we hypothesized that statistical power to detect QTL also limits results. To address this limitation, we developed a strategy for using allelic series from one cohort to map QTL in a second cohort.
