            A promise of genomics in precision medicine is to provide individualized genetic risk predictions. Polygenic risk scores ({PRS}), computed by aggregating effects from many genomic variants, have been developed as a useful tool in complex disease research. However, the application of {PRS} as a tool for predicting an individual’s disease susceptibility in a clinical setting is challenging because {PRS} typically provide a relative measure of risk evaluated at the level of a group of people but not at individual level. Here, we introduce a machine-learning technique, Mondrian Cross-Conformal Prediction ({MCCP}), to estimate the confidence bounds of {PRS}-to-disease-risk prediction. {MCCP} can report disease status conditional probability value for each individual and give a prediction at a desired error level. Moreover, with a user-defined prediction error rate, {MCCP} can estimate the proportion of sample (coverage) with a correct prediction.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02928},
	abstract = {This paper introduces the jackknife+, which is a novel method for constructing predictive conﬁdence intervals. Whereas the jackknife outputs an interval centered at the predicted response of a test point, with the width of the interval determined by the quantiles of leave-one-out residuals, the jackknife+ also uses the leave-one-out predictions at the test point to account for the variability in the ﬁtted regression function. Assuming exchangeable training samples, we prove that this crucial modiﬁcation permits rigorous coverage guarantees regardless of the distribution of the data points, for any algorithm that treats the training points symmetrically. Such guarantees are not possible for the original jackknife and we demonstrate examples where the coverage rate may actually vanish. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that the jackknife and the jackknife+ intervals achieve nearly exact coverage and have similar lengths whenever the ﬁtting algorithm obeys some form of stability. Further, we extend the jackknife+ to K-fold cross validation and similarly establish rigorous coverage properties. Our methods are related to cross-conformal prediction proposed by Vovk [2015] and we discuss connections.},
